I have a small and highly disorganized basement workshop. My dream is to create sellable products one day. But for now, I’m just a shop tool hoarder who tinkers when I can find the time. I hope to document my journey here, please join me! I am currently based in the Pioneer Valley of Western Massachusetts, although my roots are in the Pacific Northwest. The name Wallowa comes from Wallowa Lake near Joseph, Oregon. The area was named Wallowa - meaning “winding water” - by the Nez Perce. It’s one of my favorite places. When I’m not in the wood shop, I enjoy traveling, camping, kayaking, and fiddling with technology. I am gainfully employed in the technology industry. – David ","date":"2021-02-24","objectID":"/about/:1:0","series":null,"tags":null,"title":"About Wallowa Craftworks","uri":"/about/#wallowa-craftworks"},{"categories":null,"content":" Contact Subscribe or contact Wallowa Craftworks via ","date":"2021-02-24","objectID":"/about/:2:0","series":null,"tags":null,"title":"About Wallowa Craftworks","uri":"/about/#contact"},{"categories":null,"content":" ColophonThe Wallowa Craftworks website is artisanally hand-crafted using vi, markdown, the open-source Hugo static site generator, and the DoIt Hugo theme.
