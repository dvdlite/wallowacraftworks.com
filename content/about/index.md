## About Wallowa Craftworks

<img align=right width=25% hspace=15 vspace=15 src="/images/wallowa-craftworks-white-background.png">
Wallowa Craftworks is my online home for blogging about woodworking and crafting with other materials such as resin. I have a small and highly disorganized basement workshop.

My dream is to create sellable products one day. But for now, I'm just a shop tool hoarder who tinkers when I can find the time. I hope to document my journey here, please join me!

I am currently based in the Pioneer Valley of Western Massachusetts, although my roots are in the Pacific Northwest. The name Wallowa comes from Wallowa Lake near Joseph, Oregon. The area was named Wallowa - meaning "winding water" - by the Nez Perce. It's one of my favorite places.

When I'm not in the wood shop, I enjoy traveling, camping, kayaking, and fiddling with technology.  I am gainfully employed in the technology industry. â€“ David

The Wallowa Craftworks website is artisanally hand-crafted using vi, markdown, the open-source <a target=_new href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> static site generator, and the <a target=_new href="https://github.com/HEIGE-PCloud/DoIt">DoIt</a> Hugo theme.
